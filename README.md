## HTML-CSS

### AboutMeInHTML
- This was a project that I worked on during my freshman year at Reitz.
- It did have css linked to in to change the style but I no longer had access to that portion.
- I will most likely work on a css portion of it to attach

## Python

### DiceRoller
- This is a program I built on my own that asks the user to input the number of sides on a dice and the amount they want to roll
- The main struggle with this was figuring out how to have the dice have independent values rather than both the dice rolling the same number each time
- This was orignaly built in replit then copied to GitHub

### Hangman

#### Goal
I wanted to challenge myself while I have been learning python, so I created what started off as a simple project. At the start I had what was an extremely basic version of the game with only a few words to chose from. Even with this I was unable to figure out how to get the computer to process a letter being repeated in a word. This caused me to only pull from a selection of words that did not repeat any letters. Too me that made the game feel too easy. If I wanted to move further through my game development I needed to get around this problem. After about a week of thinking about the problem, and some trial and error, I finally got the code to work. I know this is a smaller, more simple, task for most developers but this was a huge win for me and I hope that my code can help others learn.
##### Features that have been added since start of project
- Double letter capability x2
- More words
- Lives tracker
- Repeating guess detection
- Simpler way of checking if the player's guess is in the word
- Set the user to see one screen at a time

### ParagraphAnalyzer
This is a program that will take a user inputed paragraph or text and display the following features:
- Word count
