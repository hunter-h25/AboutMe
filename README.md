# AboutMe
## HTML-CSS

### AboutMeInHTML
- This was a project that I worked on during my freshman year at Reitz.
- It did have css linked to in to change the style but I no longer had access to that portion.
- I will most likely work on a css portion of it to attach

## Python

### DiceRoller
- This is a program I built on my own that asks the user to input the number of sides on a dice and the amount they want to roll
- The main struggle with this was figuring out how to have the dice have independent values rather than both the dice rolling the same number each time
- This was orignaly built in replit then copied to GitHub
