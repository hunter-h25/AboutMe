## DiceRoller
- This is a program I built on my own that asks the user to input the number of sides on a dice and the amount they want to roll
- The main struggle with this was figuring out how to have the dice have independent values rather than both the dice rolling the same number each time
- This was orignaly built in replit then copied to GitHub
