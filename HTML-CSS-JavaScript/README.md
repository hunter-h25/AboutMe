## AboutMeInHTML
- This was a project that I worked on during my freshman year at Reitz.
- It did have CSS linked to it to change the style, but I no longer had access to that portion.

## Portfolio Website
- Project that was assigned to me at SICTC during my Junior year
- The idea was to show potential employers what experience I have
- Some of this may be outdated
